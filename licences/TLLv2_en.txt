Copyright <YEAR> <AUTHOR OR COPYRIGHT HOLDER>

This license applies to any original work of authorship subject to copyright or related rights, including but not limited to software, text, audio, images, video, data, and other creative expressions (hereinafter referred to as “the Work”).

	- “Distribute”: to make available to third parties by any means, form, or circumstance, including remote access, private transmission, or sale.
	- “Derivative”: any modification, adaptation, translation, or any work based on the Work.
	- “Use”: includes possession, modification, reproduction, performance, distribution, or any other form of interaction with the Work.

2. Grant of Rights
		
	Permission is hereby granted, free, irrevocable, and without charge, to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, merge, publish, perform, display, distribute, sell, and sublicense this Work or any derivative, without restriction, subject to the following conditions:

	a. Non-Aggression Clause  
	Any person who uses this Work, even without redistributing it, irrevocably waives the right to initiate or participate in any legal, administrative, or extrajudicial action against any third party regarding the use, distribution, or modification of this Work or its derivatives. This waiver is automatic and a sine qua non condition for any use.

	b. Absolute and Mandatory Copyleft  
	Any form of distribution, public or private, commercial or non-commercial, of all or part of this Work or its derivatives must retain this license in its entirety.  
	Relicensing, sublicensing, or imposing additional conditions under any technical, legal, contractual, or technological argument is not permitted.  
	The mere act of communicating the Work to another triggers this obligation.

	*Note:* Purely private use not involving distribution or communication to third parties does not require maintaining or reproducing the license but remains subject to clause 2.a.

	c. Retorsion Clause  
	Anyone who violates this license automatically forfeits all rights granted herein. Furthermore, the author or any other affected user may freely exercise against that person equivalent actions that the violator would have illegitimately attempted, without any legal detriment.

3. Patents  
	The Licensor irrevocably waives all patent rights over this Work.  
	No one may enforce patent rights over any implementation, technique, or outcome derived from the Work.  
	Anyone modifying and distributing derivatives also waives patent claims over derived parts of the Work.

4. Irrevocability  
	This license is perpetual and irrevocable once applied.  
	The author may not revoke, alter, or replace the terms on copies already distributed.  
	Waivers of rights (such as patents or legal actions) are final.

5. Jurisdiction and Redundancy  
	This license shall be interpreted according to the principle of maximum individual freedom compatible with respect for others’ freedom.  
	In case of legal conflict, any interpretation preserving the validity of absolute copyleft and waiver of coercion shall prevail.  
	Clauses may be reiterated or appear redundant to reinforce their effectiveness against judicial technicalities.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty  
	THE WORK IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. THE LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS, OR CLAIM, WHETHER CONTRACTUAL, CIVIL, OR OTHERWISE, RELATED TO THE USE OF THIS WORK.

7. Identity Neutrality  
	The value, legality, and applicability of this license do not depend on the identity, morals, intentions, background, nationality, ideology, group, or history of the author or licensor.  
	No dispute about the author’s person shall affect the validity of this license or the rights it grants.
